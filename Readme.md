# srigi/type-graphql

Tested and corrected example(s) of [type-graphql](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql). Code they provide in docs or examples folder wasn't working for me rigthaway.

Also original examples are more like snippets, not full project that has everything you need to start a server rightaway.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20ish
- pnpm
- VSCode "[Prettier](https://marketplace.cursorapi.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)" extension is recommended for code auto-reformating

## Getting started

1. clone this repository

   ```
   cd my_folder
   git clone https://github.com/srigi/type-graphql.git
   ```

2. install dependencies

   ```
   pnpm install
   ```

3. run in dev mode

   ```
   pnpm dev
   ```

After starting the GraphQL server wisit `localhost:3000/graphql` from you your browser to play with API using [graphiql](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#graphiql).

Or open [requests collection](.bruno) with [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/) <img width="32" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usebruno/bruno/main/assets/images/logo-transparent.png" width="80"/>
